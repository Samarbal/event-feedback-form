# 🌟 Event Feedback Form

This is a simple front-end project I built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It's a feedback form designed for collecting attendee opinions after an event — styled with a clean and modern layout.

## 💻 What I’ve Built

- A fully functional **HTML form** that includes:
  - Full Name, Email, and Event Name fields
  - A rating slider (1 to 10)
  - Satisfaction dropdown
  - Checkboxes for feedback
  - A text area for suggestions
  - Data agreement confirmation
- A responsive and clean **CSS design** to bring it all to life
- A professional-looking **footer** with contact info and social media links

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

> This project is part of my journey in learning front-end development — I learned HTML in one week, applied it in a mini project, and then styled it step-by-step as I learned CSS.
